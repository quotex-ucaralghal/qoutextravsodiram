## What are Candlestick Patterns?

Candlestick patterns are key indicators on financial charts, offering
insights into market sentiment and price movements. These patterns
emerge from the open, high, low, and close prices of a security within a
given period and are crucial for making informed trading decisions. The
aim is to identify potential market reversals or trends, helping you
make better decisions and potentially increase your earnings.

### How Are Candlesticks Formed on a Trading Chart?

Candlesticks are like the X-ray vision of a market. You can see what's
happening under the surface, like changes in a market's strength and
direction and how emotions shape the trends.

Each candlestick represents price information in a specific unit of
time, such as one trading day in a daily chart, one hour in an hourly
chart, and so on. By changing the time frame on a chart, the
candlesticks will also change accordingly. Let's look into the
components of candlesticks next to understand how they form and what
they represent.

#### Candlestick Components

-   **Open Price:** The first price at which the asset trades in one
    specific day.
-   **Close Price:** The last price at which the asset trades in one
    specific day.
-   **High Price:** The highest price the asset reaches during the day.
-   **Low Price:** The lowest price reached during the day.

The area between the opening and closing prices is called the body. The
color of a candlestick body indicates a bullish or bearish price
movement. If the opening price is lower than the closing price, the body
color is green. Conversely, if the opening price is lower than the
closing price, the body color is red. Different platforms display
different colors, but these are the most common.

The size of the candlestick body itself offers valuable information to
traders. The longer the body, the more bullish or bearish the
candlestick is. A very long red body indicates aggressive selling
(fear), and a long green body indicates strong adoption (optimism) in a
market.

#### Upper Shadow and Lower Shadow

Almost every candle has so-called shadows (or wicks). The thin line
between the top of the body and the high of the trading period is called
the \*\*upper shadow\*\*. And the line between the bottom of the body
and the low is called the \*\*lower shadow\*\*.

The length and positioning of the shadows provide key indications of
market behavior. When the upper shadow is relatively long, it suggests
that prices were driven higher during the session but encountered
selling pressure or profit-taking near the peak. This could signify
potential resistance levels or bearish sentiment coming into play.
Conversely, a short upper shadow may imply that buyers remained dominant
throughout the session, indicating a strong bullish sentiment.

That's all regarding the anatomy of candlesticks. Understanding how
candlesticks form and what information they hold is essential in
mastering candlestick patterns. Now that we covered this part, let's
continue exploring the most common bullish and bearish patterns.

## Bullish and Bearish Candlestick Patterns

Bullish candlestick patterns indicate a higher probability of upward
price movement. It typically suggests that buyers are in control,
driving prices even higher. Bullish patterns often exhibit
characteristics such as larger green bodies, long lower shadows, and
short upper shadows. These patterns can signify a potential trend
reversal, continuation of an existing uptrend, or the formation of a
support level.

### Bullish Patterns

-   Hammer
-   Bullish Pin Bar
-   Bullish Engulfing
-   Bullish Harami
-   Bullish Marubozu

On the other hand, bearish candlestick patterns indicate a higher
likelihood of downward price movement. It implies that sellers are
exerting influence and driving prices lower. Bearish patterns often
feature larger red bodies, long upper shadows, and short lower shadows.
These patterns can suggest a potential trend reversal, continuation of a
downtrend, or the formation of a resistance level.

### Bearish Patterns

-   Bearish Pin Bar
-   Bearish Engulfing
-   Bearish Harami
-   Bearish Marubozu
-   Hanging Man

## Candlestick Research Papers: Case Studies from Actionable Market History

Now that we know the basics, an important question arises: Are
candlestick patterns a scientifically proven method or just another
fleeting "get-rich-quick" scheme? To tackle this mystery, we've
collected numerous case studies and research publications, showing you
what scholars have discovered.

### Findings of Four Candlestick Pattern Research Papers

-   A study by trading experts examining Taiwan's Stock Exchange and
    Japan's Nikkei 225 found that integrating candlestick patterns with
    advanced analytical models significantly boosts the accuracy of
    market predictions.
-   In another groundbreaking study applying deep learning techniques to
    the NIFTY50 index, experts found significant potential in
    candlestick patterns for predicting bullish market trends. This
    research, led by top financial scholars, provided a scientific
    backing to the use of these patterns in volatile markets like India.
-   Another compelling study, endorsed by seasoned financial experts,
    successfully translated candlestick patterns into practical,
    profitable trading strategies. These strategies, when tested against
    real-market data, consistently outperformed traditional methods,
    confirming the practical utility of candlestick analysis.
-   However, an extensive literature review revealed a critical insight:
    while candlestick patterns are popular among traders, there's still
    a noticeable lack of empirical research in reputed journals. This
    gap, identified by leading academics, suggests a rich opportunity
    for future scholarly exploration.

### Results of Studies on Candlestick Patterns

The collective insights from these studies paint a clear picture:
candlestick patterns are more than just a trading fad. They possess a
scientifically proven edge, which, when combined with modern
technologies, can be harnessed to enhance trading effectiveness even
more.

So, candlestick patterns are reliable for trading but you have to know
their limitations and how to overcome them. And this can only be
achieved through practice, practice, practice.

Learning to recognize a pattern doesn't mean you'll also be successful
with it. There's much more to trading than just patterns---such as
knowing exactly when to enter and exit a trade after a chart pattern is
completed or what risk-reward ratio is the most suited for your trading
style.

By analyzing trading patterns on historical data, you will find out
which patterns work the best with your strategy. Accuracy will differ
based on which asset you want to trade, the indicators used in the
analysis, and which time frame you use for analysis.

In general, trading patterns are more reliable on higher time frames
such as 1-hour, 4-hours, or daily. This is because there is more market
noise on lower time frames, and patterns tend to fail more often. One
way to filter through the noise and increase accuracy is to use patterns
in combination with other technical indicators such as moving averages,
relative strength index, macd, or bollinger bands.
